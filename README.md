# Museum website
The **Museum** website is my implementation of the landing page for the [**Louvre**](https://www.louvre.fr/en).

<!-- TODO:
1) render content for the gallery section from JSON;
2) layout of the pictures in gallery section with margin-top 50px for the first and the third collumns;
3) edit my contact-info; -->

<!-- --> upon completion of the fixed-layout application, all its pages and sections should be PixelPerfect at a screen resolution of 1920px and look good (no horizontal scrollbars) when the resolution is changed up to 1024px. -->
