# Museum
The **Museum** website is my implementation of the landing page for the [**Louvre**](https://museum-landing.netlify.app).

This landing page has an adaptive and responsive PixelPerfect layout.

Styles were written using the **SCSS** preprocessor, functionality was implemented using **TypeScript**, and **Webpack** was used to build the project.
